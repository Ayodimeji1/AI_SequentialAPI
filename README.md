Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a binary classification model using a simple feedforward neural network (fully connected network). The model is developed with the Keras API in TensorFlow and is structured to classify input data into one of two classes.

Features
Model Type: Fully connected feedforward neural network.
Framework: Keras API with TensorFlow backend.
Classification Task: Binary classification for [briefly describe what the data represents, e.g., classifying user activity as fraudulent or non-fraudulent].
Installation
Clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/binary-classification-model.git
cd binary-classification-model
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure you are using Python version 3.11.5.

Model Architecture
The feedforward neural network consists of the following:

Input Layer: Accepts input data with the specified number of features.
Hidden Layers: [Specify number and types of hidden layers, e.g., two dense layers with ReLU activation].
Output Layer: A single neuron with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.
Example architecture:

python
Copy code
model = Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_dim,)),
    Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
Data Preparation
Data Format: Ensure that your data is in a compatible format (e.g., CSV, NumPy arrays).
Preprocessing: Normalize or standardize the input features if needed.
Training the Model
Run the training script to fit the model to your dataset:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Hyperparameters
Learning Rate: [Specify learning rate, e.g., 0.001]
Batch Size: [Specify batch size, e.g., 32]
Epochs: [Specify number of epochs, e.g., 50]
Adjust these hyperparameters in train_model.py as needed.

Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
Run the evaluation script:

bash
Copy code
python evaluate_model.py
Results
Metric	Value
Accuracy	[e.g., 92%]
Precision	[e.g., 89%]
Recall	[e.g., 87%]
F1-Score	[e.g., 88%]
Inference
To make predictions with the trained model:

bash
Copy code
python predict.py --input <path/to/input/data>
Deployment
For deployment, the model can be saved in a format suitable for web-based applications (e.g., using Flask or FastAPI). The model can be exported as an HDF5 file or using the SavedModel format.

Usage Example
python
Copy code
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
import numpy as np

# Load the model
model = load_model('model.h5')

# Prepare sample data
input_data = np.array([[0.5, 0.3, 0.8]])

# Predict
prediction = model.predict(input_data)
print("Prediction:", prediction)
Future Work
Implementing cross-validation for more robust evaluation.
Exploring hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
Adding more hidden layers or using different activation functions to experiment with complexity.
